# 3284 Swerve Code Base for WPILib 2022
This is the code to run on the FRC robot running Falcon 500 swerve modules with CANCoders on each module. Gradle will assume a team number of 3284 and the code will expect the CAN IDs in `Drive.cpp`.
## TODO
* Refactor so that CAN IDs are based on `const` names
